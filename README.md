### Finite State Machine 
Based on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E45v2dD3IQU&ab_channel=TrevorPayne) video <br>
You can find the code in one document [here](https://gist.github.com/wotori/2e4aae7850eb41052be9c8d79cfaa803)<br>
Also I found a really good article about implementation of State Machines [here](https://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/StateMachine.html).<br>
And also my colleague [@rreboot](https://github.com/rreboot) found a library ["transitions"](https://github.com/pytransitions/transitions) that Is seems pretty powerful.
